        <p> My name is Dylan Kepley, and Im a middle aged 2nd generation Californian. Lived here my whole life. Love
            this place, its probably one of the best places to live. Ever since I can remember, since watching spy
            movies like James Bond and Mission Impossible Ive wanted to learn how to become a full on computer geek. So,
            at 30, after my quarter life crisis, I decided to do something about it. Which is how and why your reading
            this exremely exciting bio about myself. Apart from my dream of becoming an eventual hacker ive had to exist
            in the real world and earn a living and have noticed in the last decade or so that everything has is gone
            digital. Which has led me to where I am today and helped me become the man-child that I am. Please feel free
            to explore the rest of my portfolio.-Dylan
